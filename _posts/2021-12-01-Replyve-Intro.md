Replyve provides a seamless call experience, but through chat.

Starting and receiving a **call** is similar to any Voice/Video Call.

After your friend receives the call, **instead of using a microphone and a camera** to talk, a **fresh chat window** is opened to just chat, simultaneously on the devices of both parties.


#### **How chatting over a call in Replyve is different from chatting in apps like WhatsApp?**



* Unlike chatting in other apps, chatting in Replyve needs your immediate and all of the attention during the conversation.
* It is recommended to not do anything else on your device as long as the call is still active.
* If either party leaves the chat window, the call will be disconnected and chat windows of both parties will be closed immediately.
* If the call gets disconnected, Replyve does not save any history of your conversation.
