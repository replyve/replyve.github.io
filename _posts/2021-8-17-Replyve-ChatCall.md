* Unlike normal messaging, Chat Call needs your immediate and all of attention during the conversation.
* You must not do anything else on your device as long as Chat Call is active.
* If either party leaves chat call window, call will be terminated and chat windows of both parties will be closed immediately.
* Chat Call does not save any history of your conversation.
